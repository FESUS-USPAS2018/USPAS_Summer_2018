The files contained in this directory are text files to keep parameters for different column elements like conductors or electric fields.  I copied my repository over, but we will not be using all of these in the course.  In fact, I will probably be removing the ones we are not using (pretty much all of them) so that by the time the course rolls around, only relevant configs are present.  

However, if you need to get pre-approval to install anything, you may want to discuss these configs.  I can't imagine anyone will have a problem with files that keep parameters, but they are here to view if you need to.
