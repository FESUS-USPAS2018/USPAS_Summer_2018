# Introduction
In this summer course, we will be working with 
* a Python code for photoemission process
* a FORTRAN code for N-particle simulation inside the gun
* *Warp*, a widely-used Particle-In-Cell simulation code

Here is the instructions for how to get prepared before come to the course.

# Get a Linux environment (Windows Users only):
Since *Warp* only support Linux and Mac OS, Windows users need construct a Linux environment first. For Windows 10 users, please check out folder [Setup_for_Windows](https://github.com/XukunXiang/USPAS_Summer_2018/blob/master/Setup_for_Windows) for further instructions. 

# Python preparation:
Now that we are all in Linux/MacOS environment, we are now moving on to install necessary libraries/packages and setup a sandbox for installing *Warp*. 
[Here](https://github.com/XukunXiang/USPAS_Summer_2018/tree/master/python_sandbox) is some instructions and tips.

# Install *Warp*
After setup the right Python environment, we can now install *Warp*. [Here](https://github.com/XukunXiang/USPAS_Summer_2018/tree/master/warp) are some instructions/tips.

# Python code for photoemission

# FORTRAN code for N-particle simulation
You can find the N-partice simulation code we are going to use [here](https://github.com/XukunXiang/USPAS_Summer_2018/tree/master/N_Particle_simulation). Since we've already installed a FORTRAN compiler during *Warp* installation, such as *gfortran*, no extra preparation is need at this point.
